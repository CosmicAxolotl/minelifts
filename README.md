### Concepts for Minelifts Classic:
> *See the concepts that we'll use for the minigame.*

1. **Crystal Coves:**
   - Covers from floor 1 to floor 10. The main idea is "light & darkness", whereas darkness help players to wipe areas, the puzzles will be about light refraction. Mobs will be stronger & enduring on light presence. Remember to embrase the darkness!

2. **Sporeshrooms:**
   - Covers from floor 11 to floor 20. The main concept is sporulation, whereas mushrooms can poison players, spores can make enemies sprout out, including that dead mobs can produce spores that can make new mobs spawn. Light & fire can stop temporally the sporulation effect, so fire shrines & fire weapons are indispensable, thought watchout with gas leaks.

3. **Strongshafts:**
   - Covers from floor 21 to floor 30. The main concept is the union of vanilla mineshafts & strongholds, which conbination is known as strongshaft
